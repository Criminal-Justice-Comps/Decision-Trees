# Decision-Trees
Code and Toy Data for Decision Trees.

Data for the DTs is stored in the Data directory.

Pre-trained trees with their predictions and correct labels are stored in the Saved Trees directory.

To create a new DT, run DT.py (instructions at the top of the file).

To test a DT using its predictions, run CheckDT.py (instructions at the top of the file).

See metrics.txt for information about how previous DTs have run.
